# Plantarchy - Plants in Anarchy

What do you get when you combine r/place, Conway's game of life, a farming sim, Splatoon, .io games, and classic Go? Meet Plantarchy, a chaotic concoction of all your favorite games in one!

Plantarchy is a simple, fast-paced online multiplayer strategy game that will have you frantically farming for berries and diabolically blowing up your opponent's turf.

The game is played on a 35x35 grid, representing your farmland. From the moment you plant your first seed, the field is constantly evolving, and you are racing against your opposing plant species to claim turf. Harvest berries, use special attacks, and climb the leaderboard.
